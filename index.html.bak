<h2>Achivements</h2>
<p>Jesse Waterson's first invention was in the year 3000 BC; Cancer.</p>
<p>As the inventer of the time machine, J. was one of the first people with the opportunity to travel back in time. Even though he was born in 2010, the attack kickstarting his career took place 3000 years before AD. His first test run of the device was travelling back to 2001, where he would stay until October.</p>
<p>As he had possession of a time machine, Jesse had the unique opportunity to perfectly time his attacks. His breakthrough carcinogen, blue asbestos, he thought was too spectacular to only introduce it then, in 2017. It was then he decided to take his seventh trip back in time, to take his spectacular disease to ancient Roman times. His reasoning was that the healthcare was less effective and his brand new bioweapon would therefore harm more people.</p><br>
